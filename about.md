I'm Jamie Houston, a software engineer with over 20 years of experience in mobile and full-stack development. Currently working as a Lead Member of Technical Staff at Salesforce, I specialize in taking complex enterprise applications and frameworks from conception to production.

## What I Do

My expertise spans across multiple domains:

- **Mobile Development**: Native and cross-platform apps using Xamarin, Android, and iOS
- **AI Tooling**: Building intelligent development workflows and automation
- **Full-Stack Development**: From database design to front-end implementation
- **Technical Leadership**: Leading teams and architecting scalable solutions

## Recent Focus

I'm particularly interested in:

- **Productivity Systems**: Building better workflows with tools like Obsidian and Claude Code
- **AI-Enhanced Development**: Using AI tools to improve development efficiency
- **Developer Experience**: Creating tools and processes that make development more enjoyable

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, optimizing workflows, and sharing what I learn through writing and teaching.

I also perform improv comedy at [The Improv Shop](https://www.theimprovshop.com/) in St. Louis, which keeps me creative and helps with quick thinking under pressure - skills that surprisingly translate well to debugging production issues!

## Personal Life

I'm blessed to share my life with my wonderful wife and our three amazing kids. Our household is completed by two cats who serve as excellent rubber duck debugging partners (though they're terrible at spotting syntax errors).
