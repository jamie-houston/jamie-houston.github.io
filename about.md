I'm Jamie Houston, a software engineer with over 20 years of experience in mobile and full-stack development. Currently working as a Lead Member of Technical Staff at Salesforce, I specialize in taking complex enterprise applications and frameworks from conception to production.

## What I Do

My expertise spans across multiple domains:

- **Mobile Development**: Native and cross-platform apps using Xamarin, Android, and iOS
- **AI Tooling**: Building intelligent development workflows and automation
- **Full-Stack Development**: From database design to front-end implementation
- **Technical Leadership**: Leading teams and architecting scalable solutions

## Recent Focus

I'm particularly interested in:

- **Productivity Systems**: Building better workflows with tools like Obsidian and Claude Code
- **AI-Enhanced Development**: Using AI tools to improve development efficiency
- **Developer Experience**: Creating tools and processes that make development more enjoyable

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, optimizing workflows, and sharing what I learn through writing and teaching.
