# AI Showdown: Planning the Perfect Thanksgiving Turkey

Every Thanksgiving, I make a recipe similar to this [turkey recipe](https://www.marthastewart.com/353184/perfect-roast-turkey) (thanks Martha!). It's not complicated, but on Thanksgiving day, every dish is a dance with father time.

Everything needs to work backwards from the magic minute (which could be the kids starving or the next game starts...)

A few years ago, I decided to let AI do the hard work. But which AI? I threw the same prompt at [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app), and [Claude](https://claude.ai/) to see who would be my new best friend (or at least assistant).

**Spoiler alert:** Only one got it right.  And if you've read my other blog posts, you already know which one it was.

## The Challenge

Here's Martha's recipe (abbreviated):

**Martha Stewart's Perfect Roast Turkey:**
1. **Prep turkey:** Let pre-brined turkey stand at room temperature for 2.5 hours
2. **Make butter-wine mixture:** Melt butter with white wine
3. **Prep cheesecloth:** Soak large cheesecloth in butter-wine mixture
4. **Season and drape:** Season turkey, drape with soaked cheesecloth
5. **Roast:** Put the bird in the oven
6. **Remove cheesecloth:** At some point, remove the cheesecloth
7. **Baste:** Every 30 minutes, baste with butter-wine mixture
8. **Remove:** At a certain time based on weight, remove from oven
9. **Rest:** 30 minutes before carving

Simple enough, right? But when you're working with a 13-pound bird that needs basting every 30 minutes and you want to eat at 5pm, suddenly you're doing mental math while trying to figure out if you have enough cheesecloth.

## The Prompt

I gave each AI the exact same prompt:

> **"Summarize the steps and times for this recipe. I want to eat at 5pm and it's a 13 pound turkey."**
>
> *[Full recipe details provided]*

I wanted:
- Start times for each step
- Duration of each step
- Adjusted measurements based on the 13-pound turkey
- Everything working backwards from the 5pm deadline

Let's see how they did.

## Round 1: ChatGPT

![ChatGPT Logo](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1677442136019-21780ecad995?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2070&q=80){: .img-fluid}

ChatGPT came out swinging with a nicely formatted timeline. Clean sections, confident tone, exact times.

**What ChatGPT Got Right:**
- Proper formatting with timestamps
- Remembered all the major steps
- Calculated the 2.5-hour room temperature rest correctly

**What ChatGPT Got Wrong:**
- Told me to start roasting at **2:15pm**
- That would put a fully cooked turkey on my counter at 5:00pm...when I want to **start eating** at 5pm
- Completely forgot about the 30-minute resting period before carving
- Math: 13 lbs × 13 min/lb = 169 minutes ≈ 2.8 hours roasting, but then just...ignored the rest time
- Also forgot that I need to baste every 30 minutes, meaning I can't just walk away

**Score: 6/10** - Got the individual calculations right but botched the crucial "work backwards from dinner time" requirement. In a real kitchen, this would mean serving turkey at 5:30pm to angry relatives.

## Round 2: Google Gemini

Gemini took a different approach - more conversational, less rigid timeline.

**What Gemini Got Right:**
- Acknowledged the resting time exists (progress!)
- Provided helpful tips about food safety and cheesecloth technique
- Remembered the 2.5-hour room temperature step

**What Gemini Got Wrong:**
- Vague on actual start times ("Start prepping mid-morning")
- When pressed for specifics, gave me times that would have turkey ready at 5pm...before resting
- Math was close but timing was still off
- Suggested I could "adjust as needed" - thanks, that's why I asked AI to do the math!
- Didn't account for the basting interruptions every 30 minutes

**Score: 7/10** - Better awareness of all the steps, but still didn't nail the critical timing. Would result in either rushing the rest period or eating late.

## Round 3: Claude

![Claude AI](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535378917042-10a22c95931a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2070&q=80){: .img-fluid}

Claude came in last (alphabetically) but delivered what the others couldn't.

**The Full Timeline Claude Provided:**

```
Target: Dinner at 5:00 PM
Turkey: 13 pounds (pre-brined)

THANKSGIVING DAY
11:30 AM - Remove turkey from fridge, let stand at room temp
12:00 PM - Prepare butter-wine mixture and cheesecloth
1:00 PM - Season turkey, drape with soaked cheesecloth
1:15 PM - Turkey goes in oven at 450°F (2 hours 50 minutes)
1:45 PM - First basting (every 30 min after)
2:15 PM - Second basting
2:45 PM - Third basting
3:15 PM - Fourth basting
3:45 PM - Fifth basting
4:05 PM - Remove from oven, begin 30-minute rest
4:35 PM - Carving begins
5:00 PM - Dinner is served
```

**What Claude Got Right:**
- **Everything**
- Worked backwards from 5pm including the rest time
- Included the 2.5-hour room temperature step (started early to give buffer)
- Accounted for prep time between steps
- **Scheduled all five basting sessions at 30-minute intervals**
- Even noted when carving should begin
- Roast time: 13 lbs × 13 min/lb ≈ 169 minutes ≈ 2.8 hours
- 30-minute rest period
- All steps sequenced properly

**What Claude Got Wrong:**
- Nothing. Seriously, I followed this timeline (set alarms for basting) and ate at 5:02pm (because I was slow carving).

**Score: 10/10** - This is what I actually needed. A working timeline that accounts for reality, including those annoying-but-necessary basting interruptions.

## Why This Matters

![Critical Thinking](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1434030216411-0b793f4b4173?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2070&q=80){: .img-fluid}

"But Jamie," you might say, "it's just turkey timing. Who cares?"

Here's why this seemingly trivial test matters:

### 1. Real-World Constraints

This wasn't "solve for X" math. It was **"work backwards from a hard deadline while accounting for multiple dependencies and recurring interruptions."** That's exactly what we ask AI to do in software planning, project management, and logistics.

If an AI can't figure out when to start cooking a turkey (with basting reminders!) to eat at 5pm, should I trust it to plan a deployment schedule with health checks and rollback windows?

### 2. Attention to Detail

The difference between ChatGPT and Claude was **one 30-minute rest period**. Small detail, big consequence. In cooking, that's the difference between juicy turkey and dry turkey. In code, that's the difference between working software and a production incident.

### 3. Implicit Requirements

I didn't explicitly say "account for resting time in your backwards calculation." Claude inferred that "eat at 5pm" means "finished cooking, rested, and ready to carve at 5pm." ChatGPT took it literally as "out of the oven at 5pm."

This kind of requirement ambiguity is **everywhere** in real work. The AI that can correctly infer intent is more useful.

## The Takeaway

This isn't a "Claude is better than ChatGPT" post (though...you know). It's about understanding that different AI models handle **temporal reasoning** and **constraint satisfaction** differently.

For simple questions and creative writing, they're all pretty good. For multi-step planning with hard deadlines and dependencies? Test them. Verify their work. Check the math.

**What I Learned:**
- When timing matters, I'm using Claude
- ChatGPT is still my go-to for creative brainstorming
- Gemini has solid safety awareness but needs to commit to specifics
- No AI is perfect - but some are better at specific tasks

## Try It Yourself

Here's a fun experiment: Take a recipe (or project plan, or travel itinerary) with time-dependent steps and a hard deadline. Give it to multiple AI models with the same prompt. See who gets the timeline right.

You might be surprised at the differences.

And if you're cooking a turkey this Thanksgiving, maybe have AI double-check your math. Just make sure it accounts for the rest time.
